These topics discuss the process of deploying Magento to a production site for Magento version 2.2 and later. We recommend this deployment method for anyone with a large site who does not want downtime during deployment.

If you deploy Magento on a single machine and can tolerate some downtime during deployment, see [Single-machine deployment]({{page.baseurl}}/configure/deployment/single-machine.html) instead.

The following topics are organized to help you get started quickly. If you're new to Magento or not familiar with the technical details, start by reading the overviews.
