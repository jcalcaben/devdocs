To develop your component, use the following steps:

1. Learn about [using Composer with your component]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-development/files/composer-json.html).
2. [Build your component]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-development/build-tasks.html)
3. [Package a component]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-development/package.html)

   Use our [validation tool](https://github.com/magento/marketplace-tools) to check your package before you distribute it.

4. [Validate your component]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-development/test.html)
5. Upload the components to the Magento Marketplace.

   See the [Magento Marketplace User Guide](http://docs.magento.com/marketplace/user_guide/getting-started.html) for details.
